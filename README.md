## DataGlacier_projects
### Purpose: 
This repository is to story all of the projects that I have been working on for DataGlacier internsihp. Each branch of the repo will be related to a different project/ assignment that I have done. 

### Flask Branch
Deployed CNN classifier to classify microbial communities from fastq files using Flask webb based app for deployment. CNN is looking at the composition of kmers to determine which microbial environment the sample comes from. The only environments it can classify are: skin, gut, oral, vagina. 

#### Deployment
```
1. Clone Repository and run app.py
2. Open Link
3. Insert fastq file (new_data.txt is my test data in Flask folder)
4. click submit
```
